					Hello, My name is well...as you could (hopefully) tell Christian.
					As <br> you could probably tell, I am a very attractive fellow. All people see <br> when
					they look into my eyes is an alluring sense of idyllicity.<br>
					I am quite, in a literal sense, THE prince charming if you will. I think <br> that (very brief) ample piece of previous text should be sufficient in calming<br> my ego down for now. lets move on. For my profession after High School, I am <br>attending OCC to save a considerable sum of money. My plan from then is to
					transfer<br> to RIT and major in Computer Sciences/Software Engineering. This
					website is predominantly<br> for the use of me reflecting back onto it and see
					how far I have come since then.<br> My ambitions strive strong, I have no doubt such plans of mine will soon become reality.<br>
					Cringe ahh website fr.
